# Description
I'll be making sum random skins for any characters in RoR.

FYI:
I'm new to Blender and Unity so, do not expect crazy stuff. Hope you enjoy my hard work :)

## New Skins
Just a Zenitsu model for the Mercenary for the time being. It has some clipping issues but at least its playable lol
