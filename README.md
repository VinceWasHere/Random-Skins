I'll be making some random skins for any characters in RoR.

If you have any advice or want to report any issues with the skins, feel free to tell me - VinceWasHere#7220

> FYI: I'm new to Blender and Unity so, do not expect crazy stuff. Hope you enjoy my hard work :)


## New Skins

<details>
  <summary>Zenitsu skin for Mercenary</summary>
    <br>
      Just a Zenitsu skin, from the anime called Demon Slayer, for the Mercenary for the time being. It has some clipping issues but at least it's playable, lol
